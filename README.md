# VSIXCopyAndReplace
This Visual Studio extension adds a command to replace the selected text with the current text in the clipboard, while at the same time copying the selected text to the clipboard so that it can be pasted elsewhere.

The "Copy and Replace" command can be found in the Edit menu or in the code window context menu. By default this command is bound to the Alt-C key.
